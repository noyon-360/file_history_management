## 🚀 Getting Started

When you launch the application, you'll land on the **Scan History** screen. This is your central hub for all scanned documents.

### 1. 🔍 Scanning a Document
*   Tap the **"Scan Document"** floating action button at the bottom right.
*   The camera will open. Align your document within the frame.
*   Once scanned, you will be prompted to enter a **Document Name**.
*   *Note: If you don't provide a name, it will automatically save as "Document [Timestamp]".*

### 2. 📁 Managing Your History
The history screen is divided into two intuitive tabs:
*   **All Docs**: Every active document you've scanned, sorted by date.
*   **Favorites**: Quickly access your most important scans by toggling the star icon.

### 3. ⭐ Favorites & Details
*   **Toggle Favorite**: Tap the **Star Icon** on any document card to add or remove it from your Favorites tab.
*   **View Details**: Tap the three dots (menu) on a document to see its file path, size, and creation date.

### 4. 🔎 Searching Documents

## 🗑️ Trash Bin (Safety First)

We've implemented a "Soft Delete" system to prevent accidental data loss.

*   **Move to Trash**: If you no longer need a document, select "Move to Trash" from the document's menu.
*   **Accessing Trash**: Tap the **Trash Icon** in the top right of the main screen.
*   **Restore**: Inside the Trash Bin, tap the **Restore Icon** to move the document back to your active history.
*   **Permanent Delete**: Tap the **Delete Forever** icon to remove the file from your device entirely.
*   **Clear All**: Use the bin icon in the Trash AppBar to wipe everything permanently at once.
